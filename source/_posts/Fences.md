* an overhaul to backend data that served to highlight and remedy many critical gaps and disconnections between the user traffic and the details of the users and properties when I took on the project full-time;
* A robust set of business logic and rules that permit an intricate hierarchy of data access permissions;
* A scalable and secure backend employing best practice micro-service architecture for high velocity scaling;
* A feature rich web dashboard that parallels seamlessly to Android and iOS removing the burdensome cost of employing separate iOS and Android developers;
* A complete replacement of the Esri platform from client-side to server-side in order to fully vertically integrate our IP and data control, a system that wildly outperforms the reliability of all systems prior;
* A well-spoken, well-written, presentable, intelligent face to the business who makes positive impressions with everyone I meet.
